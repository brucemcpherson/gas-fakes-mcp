# üöÄ Supercharge Your Google Workspace Development with gas-fakes-mcp!

Tired of the slow edit-deploy-test cycle in the Apps Script IDE? gas-fakes-mcp brings your Google Workspace development workflow into the modern era, right on your local machine!

This project, inspired by the pioneering work of Kanshi Tanaike, integrates the powerful @mcpher/gas-fakes library with the Gemini CLI, creating a seamless and conversational development experience.

## What can you do with it?
